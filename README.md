# Software Defect Prediction (Kaggle Playground S3E23)

**This repository contains a solution for the Kaggle challenge: [Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 23](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e23), which involves predicting software defects using code metric features.**

---

## Overview

This Kaggle challenge is to build a binary classification model to predict whether a software file contains a defect (`1`) or not (`0`) using a range of numerical features extracted from code complexity and structure.

My approach involved exploring and comparing several machine learning models, including:
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (primary model)
- Class balancing
- Feature transformation (log-scaling + standardization)

My best model (according to Kaggle's scoring metric of AUC)  —  a basic tuned Random Forest Classifier using RandomSearchCV, achieved a **validation accuracy of 81%**, with the best **AUC of 0.7885**. These results represent a solid baseline and demonstrate the importance of preprocessing and class imbalance strategies.

## Summary of Work Done

### Data

- **Type**: Tabular data in `.csv` format.
  - Input: Numeric software metrics (e.g., lines of code, branching, operands)
  - Output: Binary target `defects` column
- **Size**:
  - Training set: 100,000+ rows
  - Test set: 68,000+ rows
- **Split**:
  - 60% Training
  - 20% Validation
  - 20% Test (local)

#### Preprocessing / Clean up

- Dropped clearly uninformative or noisy features (`locCodeAndComment`, `IOBlank`, `id`, etc.)
- Applied `np.log1p()` to reduce skewness
- Standardized features using `StandardScaler`
- Handled class imbalance using `class_weight='balanced'`

#### Data Visualization

To better understand the underlying structure and separability of the dataset, several visualization techniques were applied:

#### Class-Wise Feature Distributions

- For each feature, I plotted histograms comparing the distribution of values for each class (`defects = 0` vs. `defects = 1`).
- These visualizations revealed that many features were **right-skewed**, and raw values often had poor visual separation between classes.
- Features like `l`, `branchCount`, `v(g)`, and `total_Opnd` showed **visually distinct distributions** between the classes, especially after transformation, suggesting they may be useful predictors.

#### Distribution Comparison (Before vs. After Scaling)

- Applied **log1p transformation** followed by **standard scaling** to every feature and visualized both the raw and scaled versions side-by-side (example below).

- This allowed us to see:
  - Which features had long-tailed distributions that could obscure class separation.
  - Whether scaling improved class separability (for example, `uniq_Op`, `total_Op`, and `IOCode` showed clearer differences post-scaling).
- Even features that initially looked noisy or overlapping (like `IOBlank`, `e`, `t`) were retained temporarily for inspection after transformation, though many of these were ultimately dropped based on post-scaling insights.

#### Why I Chose to Scale

- While tree-based models like Random Forest don’t *require* feature scaling, we scaled anyway to:
  - Better **visualize class separation**
  - Maintain **consistency** across models (e.g., Logistic Regression, which is sensitive to scaling)
- Scaling helped **uncover hidden structure** in features that initially appeared flat or noisy, such as `iv(g)` and `IOComment`.

### Problem Formulation

- **Input**: 1D vector of numeric code metrics
- **Output**: Binary label — `defects`: 1 = defective, 0 = clean
- **Model**: RandomForestClassifier (`sklearn`) with calibrated probabilities
- **Loss Function**: `log_loss` (Kaggle metric)
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - `n_estimators = 200`
  - `max_depth = None`
  - `class_weight = 'balanced'`

---

### Training

- Trained using `scikit-learn` on a standard CPU machine (8-core, 16 GB RAM)
- Training time: ~2 minute
- Early stopping not applicable; Random Forest is non-iterative
- Trained and validated on fixed splits with `random_state=42`

### Performance Comparison

| Model                                                | Accuracy | Log Loss | AUC  |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|------|
| Logistic Regression                                  | 75%      | 0.55     | 0.78 |
| Random Forest (basic)                                | 81%      | 0.46     | 0.77 |
| Random Forest (tuned attempt with RandomizedSearchCV)| 81%      | 0.52     | 0.79 |

---

### Conclusions

- Random Forests performed best with minimal tuning
- Preprocessing (log-scaling and feature selection) made a large impact:
- Threshold tuning significantly improved defect recall
- Class weighting helped balance metrics on imbalanced data

---

### Future Work

- Try XGBoost or LightGBM with tuned parameters
- Use SHAP values for better interpretability
- Test the ensemble of models to improve log loss
- Explore feature engineering based on domain knowledge
